## What are EMS Web Services? 

EMS Web Services are a suite of PHP scripts which can be hosted by any Web Server and that leverage the EMS's Event Notification System and Runtime-APIs. The EMS Web Services provide a convenient way to extend and customize the EMS for your projects and environments.


## Why use the EMS Web Services? 

The EMS Web Services are tools which use of the EMS Event Notification System together with the Runtime APIs to create custom stream processing. These PHP scripts (functions that simply wrap the HTTP interface calls of the Runtime APIs) can be used in your production environment and can be modified to meet your specific needs. The source code for all web services are provided for you to use, modify and extend!


## How does it work? 

The EMS Web Services are web application scripts that run with the EMS’ Event Notification System and use the EMS Runtime APIs to create automated stream processing. Each web service provides a unique set of features and can be combined to create aggregate effects.


## System Requirements 

### Operating System Requirements

The EMS Web Services can either run alongside the EMS or on a completely separate computer. The EMS Web Services can run on Windows®, Linux and Mac OSX.

### Web Server Requirements

The EMS Web Services require a web server, such as EWS (the default EvoStream Web Server that comes with EMS) or the Apache Web Server, along with that web server’s PHP and CURL modules/plugins.
