The EMS Event Notification System provides an extremely powerful way of interacting with the EMS. At the basic level it allows you to easily understand and monitor the usage of your server. You can either poll and parse the log file, or simply subscribe to the HTTP based notifications sent out by the EMS.

Beyond monitoring and gathering metrics, you can **use the Event Notification System to create custom stream processing.** If you want to automatically create HLS or HDS streams out of new inbound streams, simply call createHLSStream in response to each “new inbound stream” event. If you want to close inbound streams when the associated outbound stream is lost, call shutdownStream when you receive a “outbound stream closed” event.



## List of Events used by the Web Services 

The following events are generated by the EMS:

- **inStreamCreated** – A new inbound stream has been created
- **outStreamCreated** – A new outbound stream has been created
- **streamCreated** – A new stream has been created
- **inStreamCodecsUpdates** – A new inbound stream has been identified with a specific codec
- **outStreamCodecsUpdated** – A new outbound stream has been identified with a specific codec
- **streamCodecsUpdated** – A new stream has been identified with a specific codec
- **inStreamClosed** – An inbound stream has been closed
- **outStreamClosed** – An outbound stream has been closed
- **streamClosed** – Some stream has been closed
- **cliRequest** – The EMS has received a Runtime API command
- **cliResponse** – The response generated by the EMS for the last Runtime API command
- **applicationStart** – This event is created right after the application is initialized
- **applicationStop** – This event is created as soon as the application has been terminated
- **carrierCreated** – Some IO handler, such as a TCP socket, has been created
- **carrierClosed** – Some IO handler, such as a UDP socket, has been closed
- **serverStarted** – The server has started
- **serverStopped** – The server is just about to stop
- **protocolRegisteredToApp** – A connection has been fully established
- **protocolUnregisteredFromApp** – A connection has been disconnected
- **hlsChildPlaylistUpdated** – Stream specific HLS playlist has been modified
- **hlsMasterPlaylistUpdated** – HLS group playlist has been modified
- **hlsChunkCreated** – A new HLS segment was opened on disk
- **hdsChildPlaylistUpdated** – Stream specific HDS manifest has been modified
- **hdsMasterPlaylistUpdated** – HDS group manifest has been modified
- **hdsChunkCreated** – A new HDS segment file has been opened
- **timerCreated** – A new timer has been created via the createTimer API command
- **timerTriggered** – The requested timer event
